The customers spending ranges from online shopping, medical expenses in hospitals, cash transactions, and debit card usage etc. the behavior allows the bank to create an analytical report and based on which the bank used to display the product offers on the customer portal which was built using java. The portal allows the customers to login and see their transactions which they make on a day to day basis .the analytics also help the customers plan their budgets through the budget watch and my financial forecast applications embedded into the portal. The portal used hadoop framework to analyes the data as per the rules and regulations placed by the regulators from the respective countries.

For this we have created a Development Data Repository to replace the entire sql request directly on the OLTP system. DDR process extracts all clinical, pre-clinical, study, product, subject, sites related information from the upstream applications like EPECS, CDSS, RCM, PRC, E-CLINICAL, EDH and after applying some business logic put it into DDR core tables.

The portal allows the customers to login and see their transactions which they make on a day to day basis .the analytics also help the customers plan their budgets through the budget watch and my financial forecast applications embedded into the portal. The portal used hadoop framework to analyes the data as per the rules and regulations placed by the regulators from the respective countries.

For this we have created a Development Data Repository to replace the entire sql request directly on the OLTP system. DDR process extracts all clinical, pre-clinical, study, product, subject, sites related information from the upstream applications like EPECS, CDSS, RCM, PRC, E-CLINICAL, EDH and after applying some business logic put it into DDR core tables.
